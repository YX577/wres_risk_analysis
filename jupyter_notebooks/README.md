# Jupyter Notebooks

[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) were used for most data and 
results processing tasks in this study. In this portion of the repository,
Notebooks are stored based on if used for data processing and analysis 
or results processing and analysis.

**Many of these notebooks have large file sizes. You may need to reload 
them multiple times or download them to a local file location in order to
view the complete notebook.**

1. **data**: Notebooks used for data processing and analysis. These 
   notebooks use a Python kernel.

   * **R**: Notebooks for data processing and analysis that use an R
     kernel. For instructions on configuring Jupyter notebooks to use
